      <p>An online event was conducted by speaker Mr. Anil Radhakrishnan on Art of live sound
recording in Movies. The speaker told all the amazing facts that happened while recording any
sound, the process of it, retakes taken while recording and the further details about releasing it. It
was an outstanding event and students got an option for making a career in this field also.</p>
